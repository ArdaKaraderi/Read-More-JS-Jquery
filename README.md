# readmore
Basic html with some JS and JQuery that automatically creates a read more button if character count of text is more than 100.

To implement this code to your work just copy and paste required fields and scripts that are clearly commented and please don't forget that this code is licensed and I must be credited when you use this code. The compulsory parts are commented out clearly that must be included to whole script to work.

If you download the whole file running the html file with internet connection gives you chance to see whole thing working before you implement it.

For more question send me a message.
